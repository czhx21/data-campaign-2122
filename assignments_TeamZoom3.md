 ### Description:
> Please give an overview summary of the repository which you can present to the class. 
Open Materials Database：
It is an independent implementation inspired by the database-centric high-throughput approach.
It includes the following：
Materials Search: This search allows you to find any information we have in the database related to a specific material.
Results Search: This search allows you to find computational results; i.e., data relating to a submitted project or computer calculation.
Manual Query: This is an advanced query tool that gives full access to intricate searches in our database. A more precise documentation will be added in the future.

 ### Description:
> Please give an overview summary of the repository which you can present to the class. 
> NIMS focus on synthesis, characterization and application of materials, involving metals, semiconductors, superconductors, ceramics, organic materials, and nanomaterials. It covers electronics, optics, coatings, fuel cells, catalysts, biotechnology and other applications.MatNavi includes Polymer DB (chemical structures, polymerization, processing, physical properties, NMR spectra, etc.), Inorganic MaterialDB (crystal structures, phase diagrams, physical properties, etc.), Metallic Material DB (density, elastic constants, creep characteristics, etc.) and Computational Electronic Structure DB (band structures obtained by first-principles calculations, etc). It also offers applications such as the Composite Design & Property Prediction System.
